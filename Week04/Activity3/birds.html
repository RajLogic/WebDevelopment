				Native to the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia, the laughing kookaburra has dark brown wing
				plumage and a white head and underside. Its beak can reach 4 inches long and is used to snatch the
				occasional snake.
				It has a <em>laughter-like call</em> and a cackling chorus can be heard at dawn and dusk.

			<h2>Lorikeet</h2>
			<p>
				The Rainbow Lorikeet is unmistakable with its bright red beak and colourful plumage. Both sexes look
				alike, with a blue (mauve) head and belly, green wings, tail and back, and an orange/yellow breast. They
				are often seen in loud and fast-moving flocks, or in communal roosts at dusk.
				The Rainbow Lorikeet mostly forages on the flowers of shrubs or trees to harvest nectar and pollen, but
				also eats fruits, seeds and some insects.

			<h2>Pelican</h2>
			<p>
				The Australian Pelican is a black and white bird renown for its large bill (beak). They are mainly seen
				on the coast - roosting on sandbanks and rock platforms , or swimming in lagoons and bays, dipping their
				oversized bills into the water to catch fish.
				Pelicans usually feed together in a group. They drive fish into a concentrated mass using their bills
				and sometimes by beating their wings. The fish are herded into shallow water or surrounded in ever
				decreasing circles.
