	<h1>Typography</h1>

	<h2>Alignment</h2>

	<p>Margins define the reading area of your page by separating the main text from the surrounding environment.
		Margins provide important visual relief in any document, but careful design of margins and other "white space"
		is particularly important in Web page design because Web content must coexist on the computer screen with the
		interface elements of the browser itself and with other windows, menus, and icons of theMargins and space can be
		used to delineate the main text from the other page elements. And when used consistently, margins provide unity
		throughout a site by creating a consistent structure and look to the site pages. They also add visual interest
		by contrasting the positive space of the screen (text, graphics) from the negative (white) space. Text blocks
		have different ways of sitting within margins. Left-justified, centered, right-justified, and justified text are
		the alignment options available on the Web.</p>

	<h2>Justified text</h2>

	<p>Justified text is set flush with the left and right margins. Justified blocks of text create solid rectangles,
		and block headings are normally centered for a symmetrical, formal-looking document. In print, justification is
		achieved by adjusting the space between words and by using word hyphenation. Page layout programs use a
		hyphenation dictionary to check for and apply hyphenation at each line's end and then adjust word spacing
		throughout the line. But even with sophisticated page layout software, justified text blocks often suffer from
		poor spacing and excessive hyphenation and require manual refinement. This level of control is not even a remote
		possibility on Web pages. The most recent browser versions (and CSS) support justified text, but it is achieved
		by crude adjustments to word spacing. Fine adjustments are not possible on low-resolution computer displays and
		are impractical to implement in today's Web browsers. Also, Web browsers are unlikely to offer automatic
		hyphenation any time soon, another "must" for properly justified text. For the foreseeable future, the
		legibility of your Web documents will suffer if you set your text in justified format.</p>

	<h2>Centered and right-justified text blocks</h2>

	<p>Centered and right-justified text blocks are difficult to read. We read from left to right, anchoring our
		tracking across the page at the vertical line of the left margin. The ragged left margins produced by centering
		or right-justifying text make that scanning much harder, because your eye needs to search for the beginning of
		each new line.</p>

	<h2>Left-justified text</h2>

	<p>Left-justified text is the most legible option for Web pages because the left margin is even and predictable and
		the right margin is irregular. Unlike justified text, left justification requires no adjustment to word spacing;
		the inequities in spacing fall at the end of the lines. The resulting "ragged" right margin adds variety and
		interest to the page without interfering with legibility.</p>

	<h2>Line length</h2>

	<p>Text on the computer screen is hard to read not only because of the low resolution of computer screens but also
		because the layout of most Web pages violates a fundamental rule of book and magazine typography: the lines of
		text on most Web pages are far too long for easy reading. Magazine and book columns are narrow for physiological
		reasons: at normal reading distances the eye's span of acute focus is only about three inches wide, so designers
		try to keep dense passages of text in columns not much wider than that comfortable eye span. Wider lines of text
		require readers to move their heads slightly or strain their eye muscles to track over the long lines of text.
		Readability suffers because on the long trip back to the left margin the reader may lose track of the next line.
