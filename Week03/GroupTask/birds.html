		Native to the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia, the laughing kookaburra is the largest member of the
		Kingfisher family, with females weighing up to one pound and growing to 18 inches in length. Its beak can reach
		4 inches long and is used to snatch a variety of invertebrates and small vertebrates, including the occasional
		small snake.
		The laughing kookaburra has dark brown wing plumage and a white head and underside. Dark brown eye stripes run
		across its face and its upper bill is black. Its reddish-colored tail is patterned with black bars.
		It has a <em>laughter-like call</em> and a cackling chorus can be heard at dawn and dusk.

		The Rainbow Lorikeet is unmistakable with its bright red beak and colourful plumage. Both sexes look alike, with
		a blue (mauve) head and belly, green wings, tail and back, and an orange/yellow breast. They are often seen in
		loud and fast-moving flocks, or in communal roosts at dusk.
		The Rainbow Lorikeet mostly forages on the flowers of shrubs or trees to harvest nectar and pollen, but also
		eats fruits, seeds and some insects.

		The Australian Pelican is a black and white bird renown for its large bill (beak). They are mainly seen on the
		coast - roosting on sandbanks and rock platforms , or swimming in lagoons and bays, dipping their oversized
		bills into the water to catch fish.
		Pelicans usually feed together in a group. They drive fish into a concentrated mass using their bills and
		sometimes by beating their wings. The fish are herded into shallow water or surrounded in ever decreasing
		circles.
